<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	Pasteboard is a quick and simple image sharing web app driven and developed by me, Joel Besada. If you are a developer and would like to contribute to (or learn from) the source code of this app, make sure to check out the <a href="https://github.com/JoelBesada/pasteboard" target="__blank" data-track="Github (modal)">Github repo</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Images uploaded to Pasteboard are stored on the server for <strong>90 days</strong>, after which they will be deleted. Anything you upload is publically available but not broadcasted, meaning it is up to you to decide who you share the images with. 
</p>
<p>
	You will not be able to delete any images that you have uploaded. If you desperately need an image removed, contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelBesada" target="__blank" data-track="Twitter (modal)">Twitter</a> and I&#39;ll take care of it.
</p>
<h2>Terms</h2>
<p>
	By using Pasteboard to upload and share images, you agree to the terms outlined in this section. <strong>Don&#39;t be a jerk and you shall be fine</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	The images that you upload to Pasteboard are owned by you, and as such, all responsibility for your uploaded images is directed to you. 
</p>
<p>
	Pasteboard prohibits posting of pornographic, gory, copyrighted or otherwise illegal material &mdash; any uploaded images that go against these rules will be deleted on sight, and further measures to stop this activity will be taken.
</p>
<p>
	Please refrain from hotlinking to images hosted on Pasteboard on any high traffic sites. Doing so might lead to the image being removed before the 90 day limit, to reduce bandwidth costs.
</p>
<p>
	Pasteboard only supports uploading of images, uploading other types of content will be prevented by the web app. Do not attempt to circumvent these preventive measures. Any non-image content will be deleted on sight.
